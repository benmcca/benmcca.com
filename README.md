Welcome to the repository for my personal website! This project is a product of my passion for web development, combining insights from courses I have taken at NJIT as well as internship experience.

## About Me

I am enthusiastic about web development and have completed three web development courses at NJIT. My internship experience played a big role in finding a passion for JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS. This website is particularly special to me as it marks my first venture into hosting a live site.

## Learning Highlights

The development of this website provided valuable learning experiences. I deepened my familiarity with JavaScript and faced challenges, especially being frustrated with CSS. Despite the occasional hiccups, the learning process was rewarding. Designing graphics for the navbar items and section headers was a particularly enjoyable aspect of the project.

## Tech Stack

The technologies powering this website include:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styles the website, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Used for adding dynamic and interactive elements to the site.
